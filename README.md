# Materialize Photo Gallery

The purpose of this project is to learn image uploading with the CarrierWave
gem, file storage using AWS S3 Buckets, and Materialize CSS.

Eventually, I would like to update the project with a React-based front end and incorporate its features into Meads Expectations, for the purpose of uploading batch photos.
